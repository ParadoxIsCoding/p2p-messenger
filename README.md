# P2P Messenger

A cyberpunk-themed P2P messaging app using React and PeerJS.

## Setup Instructions

If you are seeing `vite: command not found`, it usually means dependencies are not installed.

1. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Run the Development Server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## Troubleshooting
- **Command not found**: Ensure you ran `npm install` in the project directory.
- **Network Access**: The app runs on `0.0.0.0`, so you can access it from other devices on your network using the IP address shown in the terminal (e.g., `http://192.168.1.5:5173`).
